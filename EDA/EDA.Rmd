## Plot the Reactions Ratio by Day of Week

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
dataframe <- dataframe %>%
  mutate(react_ratio = reactions/ page_follow)
dataframe <- dataframe %>%
  mutate(publish_day_of_week = factor(publish_day_of_week, 
                                      levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Calculate average react_ratio for each publish_day_of_week
average_react_ratio <- dataframe %>%
  group_by(publish_day_of_week) %>%
  summarize(avg_react_ratio = mean(react_ratio, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the bar chart
ggplot(average_react_ratio, aes(x = publish_day_of_week, y = avg_react_ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue" ) +
  labs(title = "Average React Ratio by Day of the Week",
       x = "Day of the Week",
       y = "Average React Ratio") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Plot the Reactions Ratio by hours in day

```{r}
  dataframe <- dataframe %>%
  mutate(publish_hour = as.numeric(substr(publish_time, 1, 2)))
```

```{r}
dataframe_clean <- dataframe %>%
  filter(!is.na(publish_hour))

# Calculate average react_ratio for each publish_hour
average_react_ratio_hourly <- dataframe_clean %>%
  group_by(publish_hour) %>%
  summarize(avg_react_ratio = mean(react_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create a complete sequence of hours from 0 to 23
all_hours <- data.frame(publish_hour = 0:23)

# Join with the calculated averages to ensure all hours are represented
average_react_ratio_hourly <- all_hours %>%
  left_join(average_react_ratio_hourly, by = "publish_hour") %>%
  mutate(avg_react_ratio = ifelse(is.na(avg_react_ratio), 0, avg_react_ratio))
```

```{r}
average_react_ratio_10_to_23 <- average_react_ratio_hourly %>%
  filter(publish_hour >= 10 & publish_hour <= 23)

ggplot(average_react_ratio_10_to_23, aes(x = factor(publish_hour), y = avg_react_ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Average React Ratio by Hour of the Day",
       x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "Average React Ratio") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 0:23, labels = sprintf("%02d:00 - %02d:59", 0:23, 0:23))


```

## Confirm the non-linear relationship between followers and reactions

```{r}
# Calculate average reactions per page
avg_dataframe <- dataframe %>%
  group_by(page_name) %>%
  summarize(avg_reactions = mean(reactions))
dataframe <- dataframe %>%
  arrange(page_follow)

```

```{r}
page_df <- dataframe[, c("page_name", "page_follow")]
page_df <- page_df %>%
  group_by(page_name) %>%
  summarise(avg_followers = mean(page_follow))
page_df <- page_df %>%
  arrange(avg_followers)
page_df_subset <- page_df[1:25, ]

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
joined_df <- inner_join(page_df_subset, avg_dataframe, by = "page_name")
a <- ggplot(joined_df, aes(x = reorder(page_name, avg_followers), y = avg_followers)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Followers per Page (Subset)",
       x = "Page Name",
       y = "Average Followers") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}


# Calculate necessary limits for the secondary y-axis
reactions_max <- max(joined_df$avg_reactions, na.rm = TRUE)
reactions_min <- min(joined_df$avg_reactions, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create the plot
dual_plot <- ggplot(joined_df, aes(x = reorder(page_name, avg_followers))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = avg_followers), stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_reactions * (max(joined_df$avg_followers) / reactions_max)), 
             color = "red", size = 3) +  # Adjust size for scatter points
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Average Followers",
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * (reactions_max / max(joined_df$avg_followers)), 
                                         name = "Average Reactions")) +
  labs(title = "Average Followers and Reactions per Page",
       x = "Page Name",
       y = "Average Followers") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Print the dual-axis plot
print(dual_plot)
